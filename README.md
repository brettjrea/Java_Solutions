# Java
A collection of Java examples from Intro to Java.

Can be text edited with...
http://github.dev/brettjrea/java

Was built and tested with [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) on windows.

I opened the whole repo in [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
and confirmed that some console examples can be compiled and run in the browser based IDE.

In the terminal.

Make sure you are in the correct directory.

Compile with...

```javac HelloWorld.java```

*Note the extension.

Run with...

```java HelloWorld```

*Note no extension.
